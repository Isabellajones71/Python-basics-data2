#Numeric types
# numerical types are numbers, intergers, flotas or composites.
# In python we'll mostly deal with int and float.#
num1 = 20
print(type(num1))
num2 =20.0
print(type(num2))

#Decaring int or floats we use numerical characters without quotes.
# Type python standard library and introduce python documentation
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex
res1 = 10+30
res2 = 30-10
res3 = 20% 2

print(res1)
print(res2)
print(res3)

# Logical operators -to equate something
num_a = 10
num_b = 10
num_c = 13
#bigger than
print(num_b > num_c)
print(num_b> num_c)
#Smaller than
print(num_b < num_c)
#Bigger than or equal
print(num_b >= num_c)
#Smaller than or equal

print(num_b <= num_c)
#Check if the same
print (num_a == num_b)
##Lastly Long and Complex numbers
# Long is an integer of unlimited size
#Complex are numbers that have an addtional +bj
# b is a float and j is the square root of -1(which is an imaginary number)
#Casting-Changing things into strings or numbers
str_number = '2049'
print(type(str_number))
int_number = int('2049')
print(type(int_number))
